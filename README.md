# PublicnEUro metadata

Machine-readable, dataset-level governance metadata derived from the
[PublicnEUro DataCatalogue](https://github.com/Public-nEUro/DataCatalogue).

The generated records keep three independent facts for every dataset version:

- **status**: `active`, `archived`, `retired`, `withdrawn`, or `superseded`;
- **retrieval mode**: `online`, `cold_archive`, `external`, or `unavailable`;
- **digital use conditions (DUC)**: the licence or Data User Agreement summary
  exposed by the catalogue.

For backwards compatibility, a catalogue record without `status` is exported
as `active`.

## Status semantics

| Status | Retrieval mode | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| active | online | PublicnEUro provides the normal dataset access route. |
| archived | cold_archive | PublicnEUro holds the data in cold storage; retrieval is delayed. |
| retired | external | PublicnEUro retains metadata but directs requests to the data controller. |
| withdrawn | unavailable | Data access and contact actions are intentionally unavailable. |
| superseded | online | The version remains accessible; `replacement` identifies its successor. |

The human-readable Data User Agreement remains authoritative. The `duc`
object is a structured summary, not a replacement for the agreement.

<!-- DATASET_TABLE_START -->
**24 datasets / 25 versions**

- **Access:** 3 open access / 21 restricted
- **Participants:** 2,130 total (1,731 healthy / 399 patients)
- **Documented size:** 5.06 TB (reported for 23/24 datasets)

Figures use the latest version of each dataset. Access is restricted when the catalogue licence is `Data User Agreement`; participant counts come from the `Participants` panel; patients are inferred as total minus healthy participants. Counts are dataset-level and may include the same individuals in related datasets.

<!-- DATASET_TABLE_END -->

## Generated files

- `datasets/PN*.json`: one record per PublicnEUro dataset, with all versions;
- `exports/repository-summary.json`: compact website-facing totals for datasets,
  versions, access, participants, and documented size;
- `exports/openaire-cerif.xml`: dataset products in OpenAIRE CERIF XML 1.2,
  wrapped as an OAI-PMH `ListRecords` response;
- `exports/re3data.xml`: repository-level metadata in re3data Schema 4.0;
- `schema/dataset.schema.json`: JSON Schema for the dataset records.

The re3data export describes PublicnEUro as a repository; re3data is not a
dataset-level interchange format. The CERIF export contains one Product per
dataset version. PublicnEUro is registered in re3data as
[`r3d100014932`](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100014932) and its
record DOI is [`10.17616/R31NJO0K`](https://doi.org/10.17616/R31NJO0K).

## Record structure and terminology

Each `datasets/PN*.json` file represents one dataset. Its `versions` array
contains the governance metadata for each published version; this keeps both
PN000001 versions in one record while allowing their statuses or conditions to
diverge later.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status` | Repository lifecycle state for that dataset version. |
| `retrieval.mode` | Where and how the data can currently be retrieved. |
| `retrieval.url` | Normal access or external-request route, when applicable. |
| `retrieval.contact` | Data-controller contact for externally held data, when applicable. |
| `duc` | DUC 1.1-compatible machine-readable conditions profile. |
| `ducProvenance` | PublicnEUro mapping, source-agreement and review metadata kept outside the standard DUC object. |
| `source` | Catalogue-relative path and SHA-256 of the exact dataset JSON used to generate the version. |
| `statusNote` | Concise lifecycle explanation, required for withdrawn records. |
| `replacement` | Persistent URL of the replacement for a superseded record. |
| `catalogueUrl` | Human-readable, authoritative dataset landing page. |
| `doi` | Persistent dataset-version identifier. |

### Digital Use Conditions

DUC is a structured representation of conditions derived from a licence or
Data User Agreement. It does not replace or reproduce the legal text. The
linked source agreement remains authoritative.

| DUC field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `profileVersion` | Version of this dataset's generated profile structure. |
| `permissionMode` | `All unstated conditions are Permitted`; only explicit conditions modify that default. |
| `assets` | Dataset name, catalogue URI and DOI to which the profile applies. |
| `conditions` | Atomic permission, obligation or prohibition statements. |
| `conditionTerm` | The non-directional concept, such as re-identification or publication. |
| `rule` | `Permitted`, `Obligatory`, `Forbidden`, or `No Requirement`. |
| `scope` | Whether the statement applies to the whole or part of the dataset. |
| `conditionParameter` | Optional qualification of the atomic statement. |

The sibling `ducProvenance` object contains `mappingVersion`, `mappingStatus`,
the authoritative `sourceAgreement`, and a `conditionEvidence` entry for each
inferred condition. Keeping this information outside `duc` allows the DUC
profile itself to follow the published schema without PublicnEUro extensions.

Example:

```json
{
  "duc": {
    "ducVersion": "1.1.0",
    "permissionMode": "All unstated conditions are Permitted",
    "conditions": [{
      "conditionTerm": {"label": "Re-identification"},
      "rule": "Forbidden",
      "scope": "Whole of asset"
    }]
  },
  "ducProvenance": {
    "mappingStatus": "machine-generated-unreviewed",
    "sourceAgreement": {
      "type": "Data User Agreement",
      "url": "https://datacatalog.publicneuro.eu/dataset/PN000002%20Aggression%20Project/V1",
      "authoritative": true,
      "sha256": "..."
    },
    "conditionEvidence": [{
      "conditionIndex": 0,
      "mappingRule": "PN-DUC-REID-001",
      "sourceSections": ["terms"],
      "confidence": "deterministic-pattern"
    }]
  }
}
```

Mapping rules and their review procedure are documented in
[`mappings/README.md`](mappings/README.md). The implementation follows the
[DUC specification](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03280-6) and can use
[Common Conditions of Use Elements](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03279-z)
as vocabulary terms during review.

## Regeneration

Place a DataCatalogue checkout next to this repository, then run:

```bash
python scripts/generate.py --catalogue ../DataCatalogue
python scripts/generate.py --catalogue ../DataCatalogue --incremental
python scripts/rebuild.py --catalogue ../DataCatalogue
python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv run --with 'jsonschema[format]' python scripts/validate.py
```

Generated files are deterministic. CI incrementally synchronizes them with the
current DataCatalogue default branch and fails when committed output is stale.

Incremental generation reads each existing version's `source.path`, compares
its current content with `source.sha256`, and regenerates only changed records.
New datasets and versions are discovered from the catalogue index. Saved
`curation/PN*.json` patches are reapplied before complete records are written,
so a full generation can safely re-derive the representation without discarding
reviewed DUC fields. The README, JSON summary, and XML exports are always
rebuilt from the complete local record set. The README and
`exports/repository-summary.json` use the same statistics object, so their
published totals cannot diverge.

After manually reviewing `duc` or `ducProvenance` in `datasets/PN*.json`, use
`rebuild.py` to capture the differences under `curation/` and update the README
and aggregate exports without replacing the reviewed records. Generation checks
`curation/manifest.json` and refuses to overwrite uncaptured edits. Catalogue-
derived fields such as status, retrieval and DOI must instead be corrected in
DataCatalogue.
See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for the complete workflow.

To inspect one profile:

```bash
python -m json.tool datasets/PN000002.json
```

To change or add a mapping, edit `mappings/dua_to_duc.json`, increment its
`mappingVersion`, add a test covering the wording, and regenerate all outputs.
